# KTMPC

We propose a Koopman-based tracking MPC (KTMPC) controller for nonlinear systems to track piecewise contant references. The proposed KTMPC controller is tested with an autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) unicycle model. This repository contains the codes of the simulation implementation of our paper:
