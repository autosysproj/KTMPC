# KTMPC

We propose a Koopman-based tracking MPC (KTMPC) controller for nonlinear systems to track piecewise constant references. We demonstrate the proposed KTMPC controller both in simulations and real experiments using an [Aion R6](https://www.aionrobotics.com/r6) autonomous ground vehicle. This repository contains the codes for the simulations and real experiments shown in our draft paper:
