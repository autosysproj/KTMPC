# KPTC

We propose a Koopman-based predictive tracking control (KPTC) controller for nonlinear systems to track piecewise constant references. We demonstrate the proposed KPTC controller both in simulations and real experiments using an [Aion R6](https://www.aionrobotics.com/r6) autonomous ground vehicle. This repository contains the codes for the simulations and real experiments shown in our draft paper:
